      Hello and welcome to my portfolio site. You are welcome to either scroll
      down through the sections, or click through the navigation to jump you to
      the section you would like to see. A little bit about myself: I've worked
      in manual labor for about decade and spent some time doing inventory
      control. Neither of these were particularly exciting so I decided to make
      a total career change and jump into the land of software engineering. I'm
      finding building applications and websites, as well as working with like
      minded individuals to be a lot more rewarding. And there is always an
      abundance of information to learn in this field that I don't see myself
      becoming complacent in this line of work. My journey started with Scrimba
      which is a self-paced front end course and I think it was a really good
      introduction to software engineering. I then enrolled in HackReactor and
      completed the 12 week immersive where I worked with my peers to complete
      sprints and this was great practice for working in teams and planning
      projects from start to finish, as well as working against a deadline.
      After graduating from HackReactor I've found myself trying to learn more
      to become a better programmer and ideally a valuable asset to a company.
      If you've made it this far, thanks for reading!
