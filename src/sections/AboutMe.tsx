      Hello, I am Brandon Gomez, a software engineer currently located in Reno,
      Nevada. Equipped with a solid foundation of both back-end and front-end
      technologies, I specialize in building applications from inception to
      fruition, while continuously working to master new technologies and design
      principles. Possessing skills of collaboration, communication, and
      organization from a decade in labor, I have taken these abilities and
      applied them to a newfound career - software development. Starting with
      Scrimba, a program aimed to teach the fundamentals of front-end
      development, to Hack Reactor's immersive course, I have either created or
      made significant contributions to a number of projects. Utilizing
      templates provided by clients, or designing a website based off of
      business requirements, I have demonstrated versatility in working
      independently as well as collaboratively within teams of my peers. Using
      technologies such as React, Javascript, TailwindCSS, NodeJS, Express,
      Firebase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS and Figma, I have created websites from
      back to front, designed intuitive user interfaces, created APIs, optimized
      servers, and deployed applications. I invite you to explore my projects
      and experience firsthand the quality that defines my work and learning
      experience. Whether you're looking to collaborate on a project or explore
      job opportunities, I'm open to connecting with you.
